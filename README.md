# Bike Demand Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression  

This repository contains a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict bike demand for **BoomBikes**, a bike-sharing provider in the US. The model analyzes the impact of various factors, such as **weather conditions, seasonality, and user behavior**, on daily bike rentals. The insights help BoomBikes optimize its business strategy post-COVID-19.

##  Features  

‚úÖ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Identifies key factors affecting bike demand.  
‚úÖ **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical features for improved model performance.  
‚úÖ **Multicollinearity Analysis** ‚Äì Uses **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)** to remove highly correlated predictors.  
‚úÖ **Model Training & Evaluation** ‚Äì Implements **Multiple Linear Regression**, analyzes residuals, and validates predictions.  
‚úÖ **Performance Metrics** ‚Äì Evaluates model accuracy using R¬≤, RMSE, and predicted vs. actual demand plots.

##  Dataset  

The dataset (`day.csv`) contains daily records of bike rentals, categorized by:  

- **Temporal Features**: Season, month, weekday, holiday, and working day.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather situation.  
- **User Count**: Casual, registered, and total bike rentals (target variable: `cnt`).

## Key Insights  

üìå **Temperature and Season** significantly impact bike demand.  
üìå **Weather conditions** like humidity and wind speed have moderate effects.  
üìå **Holidays and weekdays** show a minor correlation with demand.  

These insights help **BoomBikes** optimize fleet distribution, pricing, and marketing strategies.
