# Bike Demand Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US. Due to significant revenue losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, BoomBikes wants to understand the variables that most influence demand in order to optimize business strategy for a post-lockdown recovery. This analysis uses a dataset that includes daily bike demand data alongside various factors like weather, season, and user behavior, which are essential for building a reliable model.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Cleaning

1. **Loading and Basic Exploration**: Import libraries, load data, and conduct preliminary checks (e.g., `shape`, `describe`, `info`) to understand data structure.
2. **Feature Segmentation**: Segment columns into categorical, numerical, and datetime for easier handling.
3. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Drop the `dteday` column, as itâ€™s redundant for modeling.
4. **Type Conversion**: Convert categorical variables to `category` type for better handling in model training.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Numerical Variables**: Use scatter plots and pair plots to visualize relationships among numerical variables (e.g., `temp`, `atemp`, `hum`, `windspeed`, and `cnt`).
- **Categorical Variables**: Use box plots to understand the effect of categorical variables (e.g., `season`, `holiday`, `workingday`, `weathersit`) on bike demand.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

1. **Dummy Encoding**: Create dummy variables for categorical columns to prepare data for regression modeling.
2. **Scaling**: Normalize numerical variables using MinMaxScaler to scale them between 0 and 1, making model coefficients comparable.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

### Step 4: Model Building

1. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - Fit an initial model using all features.
   - Conduct recursive feature elimination based on p-values and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to remove multicollinear features, focusing on significant predictors.
2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Calculate VIF for each feature to identify multicollinearity. Drop features with high VIF iteratively until multicollinearity is minimized.

### Step 5: Model Evaluation

1. **Residual Analysis**: Plot the residuals to check if they are normally distributed, indicating a good model fit.
2. **Test Set Prediction**: Use the optimized model on the test set to predict bike demand.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Plot predicted vs. actual demand values to evaluate model accuracy.

## Evaluation and Insights

- **Key Features Impacting Demand**: Variables like temperature, season, and year show strong correlation with bike demand. Weekday, holiday, and weather conditions have a weaker correlation.
- **Recommendations**: Insights suggest that demand may be influenced more by climate and seasonal factors than specific days, which could inform promotion and fleet allocation strategies.
